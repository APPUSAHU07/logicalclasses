> Creation_Initialization_Printing_Retrieving 
-----------------------------------------------
Question 1:
 Write a Java program to create an integer array of size 5.
 Initialize the array with the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50,
 and display all the elements using a for loop.

Question 2:
 Write a program to store array dynamically by reading the size 
 and elements from the user.
 Input as: 
 Enter size of the array:6
 Enter 6 elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 Output is: 
 Array elements are: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Question 3:
 Create a program that accepts the size of an array from the user,
 initializes the array with random numbers between 1 and 100, and 
 prints the array.

Question 4:
 Write a Java program to retrieve the value at a specific index from an array.
 Use an array {100, 200, 300, 400, 500} and retrieve the value at index 3.

Question 5:
 Write a java program to find the middle elements of a given array. 
 If array is odd then print only the middle element, if array is even then
 print both the middle elements.

 Input as : 1 2 3 4 5  
 Output is : 3
 Input is :1 2 3 4 5 6 
 Output is :3 4

Question 6:
 Write a java program to add the last and first element of a given array.

 Input as: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 Output as: 7

Question 7:
 Write a java program to print all even elements and odd elements separately
 from an array.

 Input as  : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 Even elements are : 2 4 6
 Odd elements are : 1 3 5 7

Question 8:
 Calculate Sum of Array Elements.
 Input as: 1 2 3 4 5
 Output as: 15

Question 9:
 Find Average of Array Elements.
 Input as: 1 2 3 4 5
 Output as: 3

Question 10:
 Print all elements in reverse order of an Array.
                    
 Input as: 1 2 3 4 5
 Output as: 5 4 3 2 1
